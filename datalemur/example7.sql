/*
SQL Question 7: What is database normalization?

Normalization involves dividing a large table into smaller, more specific ones and establishing connections between them. 
This helps to reduce redundancy, creating a database that is more adaptable, scalable, and easy to manage. Additionally, 
normalization helps to maintain the integrity of the data by minimizing the risk of inconsistencies and anomalies.
